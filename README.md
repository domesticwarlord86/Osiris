# Osiris
A rebornbuddy plugin to handle death.

## Setup

This plugin is designed to handle death when running OrderBot in RebornBuddy. Right now it does a few things

If in an instance, and the party is in combat, it will wait for Raise and then accepts the raise. If the party is not in combat, it releases and then reloads the profile.

If you're not in an instance and not in a party, it releases and reloads the profile.

###  ToDo:
- [ ] Add handling for not in an instance but in party.
